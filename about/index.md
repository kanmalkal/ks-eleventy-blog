I am a software engineer, who has embarked on a journey to learn Domain Driven Design.
I have started reading the book "Domain Driven Design" by Eric Evans, yeah, late to the game.  But thoroughly enjoing the process.  I am going to use these blogs to write about my experience in reading and what i learned.
