# Who am I?

I am a software engineer, who has embarked on a journey to read Domain Driven Design
I have read the book "Domain Driven Design" by Eric Evans.. yes, I can proudly say I read the book cover to cover

# What am I doing now?

I work as a full time software engineer for a fully remote software company, in Austin

I have started reading the book "Domain Driven Design" by Eric Evans, yeah, late to the game.  But thoroughly enjoing the process.  

I am going to use these blogs to write about my experience in reading and what I learned.
