I got introduced to Domain Driven Design about a year ago.  Since then have been trying to read blogs and watch videos about it.  Then, I attended a lecture by a very respected architect who came to give a guest lecture at work.  He said - the best book for Domain Driven Design is the book by Eric Evans - but don't read the book - it is repititive and boring.

So, I decided to read the book.  And being an old-fashioned reader, bought the actual hardcover and started reading, fully expecting it to get bored and dump it somewhere down the line.  Contrary to my expectations and frankly a bit surprising to myself, I read the whole book.  

## These blogs?

The next few blogs will be my experience in reading the book and trying to highlight concepts as we go.
